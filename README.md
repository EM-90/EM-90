Hi, My name is Eirik Michielsen!
I studied Front-end development at Noroff school of technology and digital media.
- I am currently diving deeper into React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and a lot of other technologies.
- Working part-time as a UX/UI designer.
- My goal is to combine UX/UI, front-end development, and my research and analytical skills to excel in product development âœ¨.
- My creative journey started with art and drawing, then transitioned to creating music. Now, I have found my passion in designing and developing functional web pages.
- I am also interested in becoming skilled at marketing products.
